We have finished:
 	adding of nodes functionality 
	adding of the weight
	Modify weight
	Delete node
	1/2 visualizing path
	
We have to:
	properly place the nodes in the UI
	make update of weight more user friendly
	clear graph smoothly
	allow user to specify path themselves	

we still have to:
	add delete node functionality - this is done
	visualize path from point a - b - this is partially done
	.. and more

Node information is stored in the nodes.txt file. User add 2 nodes at a time(for now) and deploy the nodes - after user
presses deploy those nodes are stored in the textfile. After user exits the application all node data in the nodes.txt
file are deleted.
